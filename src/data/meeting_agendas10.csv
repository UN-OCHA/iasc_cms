2389,0,1,"Improving Disaster Response by Reducing Negative Environmental Impacts: Sri Lanka Case Study The link between disasters and the environment is widely recognized, but practical steps to reduce the impacts of disaster on the environment, and the contribution of environmental conditions on the severity of disasters, are often missing in relief and recovery operations.  Experience in the field indicates that the issue is not so much a lack of tools to assess or address environment-disaster linkages, but rather challenges related to the practical application of these tools. Pro-Act Network is an international network of environmental professionals and partners which promotes environmental security and climate change solutions through sound environmental management. Pro-Act, with CARE International, has been playing a support role to many of the IASC clusters. Mr. Charles Kelly, Pro-Act Network, will provide an overview of CARE and Pro-Act's work integrating environment as a cross-cutting issue in the different clusters and more generally in disaster response.

3084,0,1,Agenda,,"Background of the report ""East Jerusalem; Key Humanitarian Concerns"". This report forms part of a series by OCHA which examines the humanitarian impact of Israeli measures such as the Barrier, settlements planning, and zoning restrictions, on Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt). The report focuses on East Jerusalem, on the area unilaterally annexed to Israel following the 1967 war. Since 1967, Israel has undertaken measures to alter the status of East Jerusalem, contrary to international law. These measures affect the residency status of East Jerusalem Palestinians, their access to education and health services, and their ability to plan and develop their communities. Combined, they significantly increase the humanitarian vulnerability of the Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem. East Jerusalem has also traditionally served as a focus for specialized medical care, university education, work, social & family relationships and for worship at the Muslim and Christian holy sites, for the entire Palestinian population of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israeli measures have increasingly cut off East Jerusalem from the remainder of the occupied Palestinian territory and construction of the Barrier is compounding the physical separation of the city from the rest of the West Bank. Therefore, while primarily focusing on the issues facing the Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem, this report will also emphasize the continuing importance of the city as a centre of life for Palestinians throughout the oPt. The report was published recently and can be retrieved through: http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_jerusalem_report_2011_03_23_web_english.pdf 2.

The reportäó»s findings include the following: äó¢        Of the six grave violations enumerated by the Security Council in its groundbreaking resolution 1612 (2005) and covered by the UN-led Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism (MRM), at least four violations are currently being committed against children in CAR: Abduction of children; Recruitment and use of child soldiers; Denial of humanitarian access to children; and Attacks against schools or hospitals. äó¢ The LRA is present and active in CAR, despite efforts to drive it from the region. The LRA is abducting children in the southeast of CAR. Abducted children are raped, used as sex slaves and forced to attack villages and kill others, including other children. äó¢ The children who manage to escape the LRA experience great difficulties returning to their families. They rarely receive much-needed assistance, such as psychosocial care, to heal from these traumatic events. These children also suffer an arduous journey home that often takes them as long as the time they actually spent in captivity. äó¢ Other findings highlight the recruitment and use of children by self-defense militias and the CPJP, as well as the need for long-term reintegration programs for children released by the APRD.

One of the common themes that has approached was that the impact of some of these trends and events led to increased internal displacement. For 2012, IDMC states that ""The total number of people internally displaced by armed conflict, generalised violence and human rights violations worldwide as of the end of 2012 was estimated to be 28.8 million. This represents an increase of 2.4 million on the previous year, and is the highest figure IDMC has ever recorded. Around 6.5 million people were newly displaced, almost twice as many as the 3.5 million during 2011.""At the same time, the priority needs of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) have not been discussed in this forum for some time. Therefore, we are particularly pleased that the following panellists will join us to discuss recent developments, themes and initiatives, and some of the priority needs and ongoing challenges for IDPs, at next weeks meeting.

Setting up Civil-Military Coordination Mechanisms in Complex Emergencies: Case Study Mali,,"Following the advance of several government opposition groups in northern Mali, an international military intervention took place to support the Malian military in order to regain control of that territory. In early January 2013, with the advance of the opposition groups towards the South of Mali, several nations, including France, started providing military assistance to the Malian Government. The conflict led to wide-spread displacement in 2012. As of June 2013, according to a report released by the Population Movement Commission, internally displaced persons were still estimated at 353,455 and 174,129 Malian refugees are still in neighbouring countries (UNHCR). Please find the latest Sitrep attached. Humanitarian activities were taking place, albeit with access constraints and amidst an environment of fragile humanitarian space. How does coordination in such a complex environment function? OCHA deployed as soon as January 2013 a UN-CMCoord officer to ensure the establishment and maintenance of essential liaison and coordination mechanisms between the Military and the Humanitarian Community.

The advent of electronic transfers, while creating clear opportunities for the delivery of vital cash transfers, has the potential to create new risks to beneficiaries' privacy as their personal data is   collected, mined, shared and analysed by a range of public and private actors in the name of humanitarian aid.

The CHS ambition is to support humanitarian actors to improve the quality of assistance and the accountability to communities and people affected by disaster. It will also enable them to demonstrate their adhering to fundamental humanitarian and human rights principles.   Earlier zero versions of the draft CHS were developed jointly by the HAP, People In Aid and Sphere teams. Although Sphere is no longer a participant in the CHS since the end of November, the drafting to date greatly benefitted from input by the Sphere project team as well as the HAP and People In Aid teams. The first draft that was shared for consultation has benefitted from considerable feedback of a recent consultation undertaken by the SCHR Certification Review, to which many of you contributed.

The project also shared a first draft proposal certification model that built on the learning from existing experiences in the sector as well as consultations with stakeholders during the first year of the project. The model was intended to stimulate discussion and generate feedback from all interested key stakeholders on what a successful, sustainable model might look like and how to achieve it. The project team received feedback from across the sector, with some 60 organizations submitting written feedback. This feedback has been used to revise the draft model which will be shared with the IASC and stakeholders in mid-January. The aim of this meeting will be to: Present feed-back received on the model; Provide an overview of the revised proposed model; Present plans for field-testing the model; Outline opportunities for continued engagement with the project.
