3607,2425,1,Description of Event,,"IASC Event: Data and Evidence about Conflict Affected People: Can we do Better? Is the data we get from crises settings good enough or can we do better? Or is it too much? These are the questions that will be the focus of this session. According to the People in Crises (PAC) Report, there has been a steady improvement in the quality of evidence produced by humanitarian actors. This is good news. It indicates that there is increased investment in this area by donors that allow the field agencies to collect data. On the other hand, is this data well used or used at all?  The discussion will briefly present the PAC Report, but mainly debate key issues for the future. These include: How to get the best out of available data: is it too little data or a lack of innovative techniques for analysis? Increasing the burden of data collection on operational staff: allocation of time and effort in the field in crisis settings. How can we increase the shelf life of data? Time gap between data collection and decision making. Join us for a discussion with Debarati Guha-Sapir from the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED), established at the University of Louvain, School of Medicine äóñ Institute of Health and Society, Brussels.

While the emergency response was by and large successful, more than four months since the storm hit, significant challenges to recovery remain. The typhoon also marked the first declaration of a Level 3 emergency by the IASC in the context of a large scale, sudden-onset disaster and offers important lessons on how to improve the implementation of the humanitarian program cycle under the Transformative Agenda. Refugees International (RI), an independent advocacy organization that advocates on behalf of people displaced by conflict and natural disasters, conducted a mission to the Philippines in February 2014 to assess the response to Typhoon Haiyan and the protection needs of those still displaced by the disaster (see links to the reports below).

Risk Reduction Index in West Africa,,"DARA will present the second report of the Risk Reduction Index (RRI), carried out in West Africa (Cape Verde, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Niger and Senegal). In West Africa, underlying risk drivers continue to increase communitiesäó» vulnerability to natural hazards, decrease their resilience overall, and potentially diminish important development gains that have been made. As in the first phase of the RRI carried out in 2009-2010 in Central America the 2013 RRI West Africa measured local perceptions of risks and has identified links between underlying risk factors and increased vulnerability, raising awareness around the need for greater risk management initiatives. The goal of the RRI is to generate knowledge in the region that will help civil society, local administrations, national governments, and ECOWAS address underlying factors of risk from a more integrated perspective. The RRI also aims to promote better integration of DRR into development, poverty reduction and humanitarian strategies and policies of all stakeholders, including operational agencies.  A main output of the second phase is the RRI publication containing the main findings of the field research carried out in 16 communities across 6 countries in West Africa, as well as a Regional Risk Mapping. The launch of the RRI publication will serve as an opportunity for DARA to share its findings from our research in West Africa and our community-based methodological approach with the development and humanitarian community.

3552,2360,1,1. Predicting the Unpredictable - A proposal for reducing supply chain waste in international humanitarian response,,"Few people involved in humanitarian response would argue that current donor funding patterns,  agency logistics, preparedness and response activities could be better directed and create a greater positive impact if they were informed by accurate forecast information of what assistance will be required.  Also, not many people believe that accurate long term needs and assessment of requirements at the point of a disaster can be forecasted. Our research project, funded by the Norwegian Research Council, set out to prove that it is possible to generate this information and support the planning process, increasing predictability and so allowing donors and agencies to develop more efficient supply chains.  In a pilot project a needs forecast model called the Humanitarian Logistics Demand Forecast (HLDF) has been created by analysing more than 30,000 data inputs across 63 disasters that occurred during 2005-2010 to create needs characterisation models for a given disaster type in a given region. The HLDF produces information that can be used to guide donors or agencies with strategic planning, as well as providing the ability to predict the demand for a particular disaster of a known size in a given area. The tool is particularly useful to initiate a response whilst waiting for results from the needs assessments being carried out. IFRC used the tool as one of the components in developing their 5 year logistics strategy, defining product volumes and the required logistics capacity. The HLDF is the first of its kind on a global basis. Given their role as a coordination platform, we are keen to seek feedback from IASC on the usefulness of this approach in coordination activities, and the validity of further development and investment in such a tool. Also, Birgitte Stalder-Olsen will share IFRC's experience to use the HDLF for their logistics contingency planning for 2014/2015. ",0,0

3544,2359,1,Geneva Call and the protection of civilians: is engagement of armed non-State actors (ANSAs) an option ?,,"Most of current armed conflict around the world involve one or several armed non-State actors.ŒæCivilians are the primary victims of these conflicts, and are exposed to all kinds of abuses. A part of these abusesŒæäóñ Œæthough by no means all äóñŒæare committed by ANSAs. However, the nature of international law makes it difficult to address the behaviour of these groups. Existing International Humanitarian Law treaties are predominantly focused on states, and, while they have obligations under IHL, ANSAs cannot become parties to relevant international treaties. Thus, ANSAs may not feel bound to respect rules that they have neither contributed to creating nor formally declared their willingness to adhere to. Geneva Call aims to promote and enhance ANSA compliance with international humanitarian norms.ŒæWhile initially focusing on land mines, Geneva Call has expanded its work on international norms pertaining to the protection of children notably the recruitment and use of children in hostilities äóñ and to the prohibition on sexual violence in armed conflict.ŒæIn its efforts to promote ownership of international standards, Geneva Call has adopted an inclusive approach, whereby ANSAs have the opportunity äóñ through signing a formal instrument called aŒæDeed of CommitmentŒæäóñ to express their adherence to specific humanitarian norms and to be held accountable for their pledge.ŒæIn recent years, Geneva Call has also increasingly provided ANSAs with customised training on broad International Humanitarian Law rules, as well as advice on how to incorporate these rules into their codes of conduct and other internal regulations.",0,0

The model was intended to stimulate discussion and generate feedback from all interested key stakeholders on what a successful, sustainable model might look like and how to achieve it. The project team received feedback from across the sector, with some 60 organizations submitting written feedback.

UNICEF's Cluster Lead Agency (CLA) Role:  How Well Has it Done and What Next?,,"The Cluster approach was introduced in 2005 and it was intended to improve emergency response through greater predictability and accountability, as well as stronger partnership between and among humanitarian actors. UNICEF serves as Global CLA for three Clusters: Nutrition, WASH and, as co-CLA with Save the Children, Education. In addition, within the Global Protection Cluster led by UNHCR, UNICEF is Focal Point Agency for the Child Protection AOR and co-Focal Point Agency with UNFPA for Gender-Based Violence (GBV) AOR. Together, these responsibilities render UNICEF the agency with the most Clusters and AORs under its remit. Evaluations, reviews and other exercises assessing UNICEFäó»s response to recent emergencies have pointed out that while the Organisation appears to be taking its CLA roles and responsibilities seriously, challenges still remain. An evaluation of UNICEFäó»s Cluster Lead Agency Role (CLARE) in Humanitarian Action was recently finalised. The evaluation was designed to undertake a systematic, in-depth and independent assessment of UNICEFäó»s performance in managing its CLA (and co-CLA) role on the Clusters under its remit. It includes information and data collected at the global level as well as eight country case studies.

However, Sri Lanka continues to be affected by small and medium scale natural disasters. These have also impacted returning IDPs and the scope of OCHAäó»s operations.  The Sri Lanka HCT and the Government of Sri Lanka are currently undertaking the first phases of a Joint Needs Assessment  (JNA) to create a baseline to target assistance from Government and ongoing relief and development activities. This will create a baseline for Government and development actors to continue in the recovery phase. In 2014, the OCHA Sri Lanka country office will downsize to a smaller Humanitarian Advisory Team (HAT) as the focus of preparedness for response will shift to the national level, with additional backstopping from the OCHA Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific, based in Bangkok. Central to OCHAäó»s work stream on preparedness for response will be to ensure that key elements of the the Minimum Preparedness Package (MPP) is in place as part of the UNDAF Pillar IV planning for Sri Lanka.",0,0

How can 'unarmed civilian peacekeeping' contribute to increased protection? The organisation 'Nonviolent Peaceforce' (NP) promotes, develops and implements 'unarmed civilian peacekeeping' (UCP) to protect civilians in these situations. NP envisions that this method ""using proven nonviolent strategies, is recognised as a viable alternative in preventing, addressing, and mitigating violent conflicts worldwide."" (NP website)The UN Secretary General's Report on the Protection of Civilians (S/2012/376) states that non-governmental organisations also play a long-established and key role in the protection of civilians. But what is UCP, how does it work in practice and how effective is it? How does it link to other notions of 'peacekeeping' and 'protection'? And what are some next steps? The IASC Secretariat is pleased to host this event, providing a space to discuss and better understand this concept from those who have applied it in situations like South Sudan, Mindanao and Myanmar.

3475,2326,1,1. Setting up Civil-Military Coordination Mechanisms in Complex Emergencies: Case Study Mali,,"Following the advance of several government opposition groups in northern Mali, an international military intervention took place to support the Malian military in order to regain control of that territory. In early January 2013, with the advance of the opposition groups towards the South of Mali, several nations, including France, started providing military assistance to the Malian Government. The conflict led to wide-spread displacement in 2012. As of June 2013, according to a report released by the Population Movement Commission, internally displaced persons were still estimated at 353,455 and 174,129 Malian refugees are still in neighbouring countries (UNHCR). Please find the latest Sitrep attached. Humanitarian activities were taking place, albeit with access constraints and amidst an environment of fragile humanitarian space. How does coordination in such a complex environment function? OCHA deployed as soon as January 2013 a UN-CMCoord officer to ensure the establishment and maintenance of essential liaison and coordination mechanisms between the Military and the Humanitarian Community.

The Internally Displaced - Identifying their Priority Needs,,"In the past few months, we discussed among others the impact of climate change, increased urbanisation and vulnerability, food security and resilience in the Sahel, the conflict in Syria, in  this IASC meeting fora. One of the common themes that has approached was that the impact of some of these trends and events led to increased internal displacement. For 2012, IDMC states that ""The total number of people internally displaced by armed conflict, generalised violence and human rights violations worldwide as of the end of 2012 was estimated to be 28.8 million. This represents an increase of 2.4 million on the previous year, and is the highest figure IDMC has ever recorded. Around 6.5 million people were newly displaced, almost twice as many as the 3.5 million during 2011.""At the same time, the priority needs of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) have not been discussed in this forum for some time. Therefore, we are particularly pleased that the following panellists will join us to discuss recent developments, themes and initiatives, and some of the priority needs and ongoing challenges for IDPs, at next weeks meeting.

Assessing the response to the 2012 food crisis in the Sahel to build resilience for the future"" will discuss the major findings of the report. Oxfam, with contributions from Save the Children and ACF, has just published a paper on the Sahel food crisis.

3464,2321,2,Background,,"In 2012, the Sahel region of West and Central Africa was once again hit by a severe food crisis, affecting over 18 million people at its peak. At the start of 2012, when the crisis began to unfold, many governments, donors and aid agencies were determined not to make the same mistakes again. This report considers how well they collectively performed, and the lessons that must be learned to improve future responses. It is important for the humanitarian community that, while continuing to address the enormous humanitarian and recovery needs in the region, to learn lessons from the 2012 response and to develop a new model that will allow better prevention and management of future crises. The growing momentum around the concept of resilience offers considerable potential to achieve this, but only if all actors work together to turn rhetoric into action that brings lasting improvements for the poorest communities across the Sahel.

3453,2318,4,Background,,"In March 2013, Norway convened an International Conference on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons. The purpose of the Conference was to begin a facts-based discussion of the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons detonation with key stakeholders. It was attended by 127 States, representatives of the UN (FAO, IAEA, OCHA, ODA, UNEP, UNHCR, UNICEF, WFP, WHO), ICRC and IFRC, independent experts and more than 150 civil society representatives under the umbrella of the International Coalition for the Abolition of Nuclear Weapons (ICAN). The Conference was framed around three themes: the immediate humanitarian impact of a nuclear detonation; the wider impact and longer-term consequences; and humanitarian preparedness and response. The discussions revealed a consensus among the majority of States that the detonation of one or more nuclear weapons, be it deliberate or accidental, would have a devastating and catastrophic humanitarian impact both in the short and long term. Its effects would not be limited in time or space and it would have major social, economic and, potentially, environmental consequences. Given the inability of national and international actors to respond in any meaningful way, the majority of States expressed the view that there was a need for an international, legally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons.

3429,2306,3,Background,,"Linking climate change or global warming to current events has long been considered unconventional. But new heat records are now broken almost every year and other abnormalities are fast accumulating: last Octoberäó»s Hurricane Sandy for instance was the largest storm ever recorded in the Atlantic. These inconsistencies are making it easier for scientists to pin effects happening now on climate change. Few groups however have studied the full implications of an already changed climate in humanitarian and development terms. The äóìClimate Vulnerability Monitoräó teases these implications out of leading research with startling conclusions, such as attributing 20% of the damage caused by todayäó»s flood emergencies to climate change. Its analysis of 24 sectors of impact and findings from field research in Africa and Asia help to explain how the shift to inhospitable climate conditions could already be a critical factor driving the erosion of rural livelihoods and fueling migration, risk and food emergencies in regions like the Sahel. Just as this research explores unchartered territories, what it means for the humanitarian community is only beginning to become clear. Independent even of the causes of climate change, the bottom line of much of todayäó»s climate science is serious growing shockwaves for the humanitarian space. ",0,0

He will discuss, why this tool is a key for disaster managers worldwide and how it can be used effectively. Thomas Peter will also present new initiatives to improve the GDACS services, how they link to other coordination mechanisms and their opportunity to support cluster coordination. During the first days after major sudden-onset disasters, the affected country and a vast number of international actors collect and analyse information in order to plan their response. This activity is typically carried out simultaneously with varying speed, relevance and accuracy, using multiple information channels and applying different procedures. During the initial planning phase, there is usually little or no information exchange between international responders. Decisions are often based on patchy information, inaccurate sources or assumptions. The planned or mobilised assistance of other organisations is rarely drawn into consideration. This often results in duplication, gaps, overlap or even inappropriate response, occasionally associated with high costs. GDACS services aim at facilitating information exchange among all actors in support of decision-making and coordination.

3329,2170,2,Background,,"Many parts of the world are affected by seasonality which is linked to variability in livelihoods, food security and incomes as well as infectious disease and sanitation problems. Seasonal contingencies can quickly extend into humanitarian disasters. But generally this is ignored in development programming. Planning for humanitarian interventions could also benefit from this perspective.",0,0

3321,2168,1,1. Clusters and co-facilitators: Lessons learnt from Co-facilitation in the DRC Protection Cluster,,"Cluster coordination varies from cluster to cluster, from country to country. Lessons learnt are emerging and expectations becoming harmonised. NGO co-facilitation, however, remains largely undocumentented territory, whilst the experience varies widely. Oxfam (since July 2010) and Save the Children (since December 2011), with ECHO funding, have placed full time co-facilitators in the DRC protection cluster. A recent evaluation looks at the lessons learnt from this, and compares the experience with other clusters in DRC and the protection cluster in other countries. It asks when cofacilitators can bring a value added to the functioning of a cluster, and what the NGO value added should be, including in countries with an integrated mission; what the engagement of the lead agency and cofacilitating organisation needs to be, what preconditions need to be in place, and under what circumstances cofacilitation can be successful.

3301,2161,1,"1. Update on the humanitarian situation, response priorities and challenges in Yemen",,"The recent political, social and economic instability as well as the deteriorating security situation in Yemen have had a high toll on the civilian population, plunging the country into an acute humanitarian crisis. Over the past two years, severe food insecurity has doubled affecting 10 million people and almost 1 million children under age 5 suffer from malnutrition.

3302,2161,2,Background,,"The scale of the humanitarian crisis goes beyond those that are displaced by conflict and affects nearly all parts of the country with millions of Yemenis in acute need of assistance. There is a need to readjust our perception of Yemen as an underdeveloped country having few conflict-induced humanitarian needs among a small section of war-affected and displaced people. Instead, the humanitarian crisis affects all parts of the population in all areas of the country.The humanitarian response has been significantly expanded in 2012 to address the growing humanitarian needs in Yemen. However, there are a number of challenges to the delivery of assistance; key among them are capacity, security and funding.

3280,2153,1,1. Financing Preparedness - Findings of a Study (1st Phase) and What to Do About Them,,"In the context of rising demands placed on the humanitarian system and constrained donor finances, and considering a seeming inability to have all in place that we need for crises that we know very well will occur, preparedness is being discussed and developed at many levels and many stakeholders. In early 2011 the IASC tasked FAO as Task Team lead for Preparedness Financing to examine in detail the financing architecture. Development Initiatives was asked to examine this issue in detail. Questions were asked of not just financing and financing models themselves but also of definitions, institutions, donors, aid structures and actors of all kinds. The result of this work was a report launched by FAO and the IASC in December 2011. Part of this work was also an initiative to track funding for emergency preparedness over a longer period of time, through to the middle of 2012. A final piece of work has now been undertaken to place the results of that tracking exercise in context of the developments in policy and practice. ",0,0
3281,2153,2,Background,,"The results of this work are mixed. Although much of the humanitarian system is discussing preparedness and policy is being developed, there has been no increase in actual funding over the tracking period. Humanitarian financing mechanisms and the CAP have not changed significantly to provide more opportunities for preparedness financing. Donors are debating what to do with preparedness and are looking for options for financing but there has been little movement to date. Resilience is taking more and more of the focus which could impact both positively and negatively on financing for preparedness. Under the umbrella of resilience, there are new opportunities and challenges.",0,0

The humanitarian response to the initial catastrophe has developed in context of multiple crises, including the cholera epidemic, hurricanes, and political and security challenges. Transition to recovery has been strong on the agenda as a result of growing desire to move away from humanitarian response and relief and offer durable solutions to existing needs amidst increasing funding constraints.

3103,2074,2,Background,,"Ben Parker is a specialist in humanitarian affairs and media.

3088,2069,2,Background,,"Gender-based violence (GBV) encompasses a wide range of human rights violations and can be directed at women, men, girls and boys. GBV takes the form of rape, domestic violence, sexual assault and harassment, trafficking of women, girls and boys and several harmful traditional practices including female genital mutilation/cutting, child marriage, bride inheritance and many others. It is pervasive in times of peace. In times of crisis, GBV may become more extreme. In armed conflict, one form of GBV, sexual violence, can become so widespread and systematic that it is considered a weapon in conflict and can escalate into crimes against humanity, war crimes or be part of the crime of genocide.

3057,2023,2,Background:,,"Humanitarian concern for Syria continues as the civil unrest enters its eighth month. According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, security forces have killed more than 2,900 people. Thousands of others have been injured, displaced or detained since mid-March. A UN humanitarian mission, which was led by OCHA and took place in late August, concluded that the humanitarian situation in Syria could be characterised as having pockets of humanitarian needs, but that they together could not be described as a country-wide humanitarian crisis urgently requiring international assistance. However, the humanitarian situation may further deteriorate. Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed has served as Resident Coordinator in Syria since May 2008 and was designated Humanitarian Coordinator in August this year.

He will provided examples from recent crises to illustrate both the challenges as well as some lessons learned. UN-HABITAT chairs the Housing, Land and Property Area of Responsibility within the Protection Cluster.",0,0
3054,2022,2,Background,,"Unaddressed land issues contribute to the increased negative impact of both natural disasters and violent conflict. Poor land-use increases vulnerability to natural disasters, as demonstrated in New Orleans, Port-au-Prince and the Horn of Africa.  Landäó»s critical importance to livelihoods, investment, group identity and the distribution of power make it a potent factor in the outbreak or continuation of conflict and to the success or failure of post-conflict peace-building. Land issues directly affect many aspects of humanitarian action. Land is needed for emergency shelter or camps, for livelihoods and food security, for temporary roads and other critical infrastructure.  Land mines and unexploded ordnances (UXOs) limit available land for any use. Lack of clarity regarding land rights can delay humanitarian response, can undermine the effectiveness of assistance, can contribute to or exacerbate conflicts and can even place humanitarian staff at risk. Humanitarians are increasingly aware of the need to understand how land issues will affect their interventions and the affect of their interventions on land issues.  The challenge is to ensure that humanitarian action contributes to long-term solutions that address core vulnerabilities and root causes of crises. Early engagement of national and international land expertise is a critical input to humanitarian action.",0,0

To guide the durable solutions process, the IASC Framework on Durable Solutions for Internally Displaced Persons was developed to assist all stakeholders in their work. The Framework clarifies the concept of a durable solution and outlines key principles and criteria that can be used to identify suitable strategies and activities to assist IDPs and to gauge the achievement of a durable solution. While discussions of durable solutions have had a particular focus on return, the Framework places no hierarchy among settlement options for IDPs. This allows for consideration of local integration and settlement elsewhere on a par with return. ",0,0

Dadaab Information Needs Assessment: Communication is AID Jacobo Quintanilla, Director of Humanitarian Media at Internews (www.internews.org), will brief on the findings of the joint humanitarian communication needs assessment conducted in Dadaab in August 2011 to understand the informationneeds of refugees and explore ways to improve the flow of communication between refugees, aid agencies, and host communities. Internews and the BBC World Service Trust are partners in the infoasaid (http://infoasaid.org/) DfID funded consortium focusing on improving how aid agencies communicate with disaster-affected communities. The emphasis is on the need to deliver information, as aid itself, through the most appropriate channels. Anita Shah, Head of Infoasaid, will introduce the project.  Background: Serious communication gaps between the humanitarian sector and refugees in Dadaab, Kenya, are increasing refugee suffering and putting lives at risk, according to this new joint assessmentreport.  Radio is by far the most popular source of general information for both new arrivals and long-term refugees, yet there is no specific regular broadcast for or about Dadaab. Critically, humanitarian workers, government officials, along with army andpolice, rank the lowest as sources of information for refugees, both for new arrivals and long-term residents, according to the report. The assessment team trained a group of local volunteers from the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) on usingsmart phones with data collection software designed by Episurveyor to conduct over 640 interviews for the survey. See video.The assessment was led byInternews and conducted with Radio Ergo/International Media Support (IMS) and Star FM of Kenya with support from NRC.

2995,1994,2,Background,,"The eastern Horn of Africa has now experienced two consecutive season of significantly below-average rainfall. This has resulted in failed crop production, substantial livestock mortality, and has driven food prices to record levels. Millions of people in the region cannot meet basic survival needs and emergency levels of acute malnutrition are wide-spread. This crisis likely represents the most serious food insecurity situation in the world today, in terms of both scale and severity. Current humanitarian response is inadequate to meet emergency needs according to an inter-agency scenario building analysis at the end of May. Furthermore, FEWSNET with partners estimated that  2011 is the driest year or second direst year in the Eastern Horn of Africa  since 1950/51 in some areas and the food security situation for pastoralists and marginal agriculturalists  is not likely to improve until early 2012.  A food security emergency will persist over the coming months in the eastern Horn given the expectation of late and below average summer harvests, early depletion of pasture and water, and continued high prices for food, water, and fuel .'

To achieve this goal, GRIP has two specific objectives: to improve disaster risk information and to increase its use in decision-making processes.  GRIPäó»s actions to help countries reach the HFA goal are divided in the following three main activities: (a) developing capacity; (b) generating basic risk information and baselines, and (c) monitoring and reporting.  To support countries with their risk assessment needs, GRIP has developed a comprehensive risk assessment package with activities at national and local levels. The package includes the implementation of multi-hazard National Risk Assessments, the establishment of National Disaster Observatories and the preparation of the National Urban Risk Report.

3084,0,1,Agenda,,"Background of the report ""East Jerusalem; Key Humanitarian Concerns"". This report forms part of a series by OCHA which examines the humanitarian impact of Israeli measures such as the Barrier, settlements planning, and zoning restrictions, on Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt). The report focuses on East Jerusalem, on the area unilaterally annexed to Israel following the 1967 war. Since 1967, Israel has undertaken measures to alter the status of East Jerusalem, contrary to international law. These measures affect the residency status of East Jerusalem Palestinians, their access to education and health services, and their ability to plan and develop their communities. Combined, they significantly increase the humanitarian vulnerability of the Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem. East Jerusalem has also traditionally served as a focus for specialized medical care, university education, work, social & family relationships and for worship at the Muslim and Christian holy sites, for the entire Palestinian population of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israeli measures have increasingly cut off East Jerusalem from the remainder of the occupied Palestinian territory and construction of the Barrier is compounding the physical separation of the city from the rest of the West Bank. Therefore, while primarily focusing on the issues facing the Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem, this report will also emphasize the continuing importance of the city as a centre of life for Palestinians throughout the oPt. The report was published recently and can be retrieved through: http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_jerusalem_report_2011_03_23_web_english.pdf 2. Children and Armed Conflict in the Central African Republic (16h45-17h00) Ms. Eva Smets, Director, Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict, will introduce the report ""An uncertain future: Children in Armed Conflict in the Central African Republic."" Printed copies of the report will be available at the meeting. The reportäó»s findings include the following: äó¢        Of the six grave violations enumerated by the Security Council in its groundbreaking resolution 1612 (2005) and covered by the UN-led Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism (MRM), at least four violations are currently being committed against children in CAR: Abduction of children; Recruitment and use of child soldiers; Denial of humanitarian access to children; and Attacks against schools or hospitals. äó¢ The LRA is present and active in CAR, despite efforts to drive it from the region. The LRA is abducting children in the southeast of CAR. Abducted children are raped, used as sex slaves and forced to attack villages and kill others, including other children. äó¢ The children who manage to escape the LRA experience great difficulties returning to their families. They rarely receive much-needed assistance, such as psychosocial care, to heal from these traumatic events. These children also suffer an arduous journey home that often takes them as long as the time they actually spent in captivity. äó¢ Other findings highlight the recruitment and use of children by self-defense militias and the CPJP, as well as the need for long-term reintegration programs for children released by the APRD.

One of the common themes that has approached was that the impact of some of these trends and events led to increased internal displacement. For 2012, IDMC states that ""The total number of people internally displaced by armed conflict, generalised violence and human rights violations worldwide as of the end of 2012 was estimated to be 28.8 million.

Around 6.5 million people were newly displaced, almost twice as many as the 3.5 million during 2011.""At the same time, the priority needs of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) have not been discussed in this forum for some time.

3474,0,1,1. Setting up Civil-Military Coordination Mechanisms in Complex Emergencies: Case Study Mali,,"Following the advance of several government opposition groups in northern Mali, an international military intervention took place to support the Malian military in order to regain control of that territory. In early January 2013, with the advance of the opposition groups towards the South of Mali, several nations, including France, started providing military assistance to the Malian Government. The conflict led to wide-spread displacement in 2012. As of June 2013, according to a report released by the Population Movement Commission, internally displaced persons were still estimated at 353,455 and 174,129 Malian refugees are still in neighbouring countries (UNHCR). Please find the latest Sitrep attached. Humanitarian activities were taking place, albeit with access constraints and amidst an environment of fragile humanitarian space. How does coordination in such a complex environment function?

It will also enable them to demonstrate their adhering to fundamental humanitarian and human rights principles.   Earlier zero versions of the draft CHS were developed jointly by the HAP, People In Aid and Sphere teams. Although Sphere is no longer a participant in the CHS since the end of November, the drafting to date greatly benefitted from input by the Sphere project team as well as the HAP and People In Aid teams. The first draft that was shared for consultation has benefitted from considerable feedback of a recent consultation undertaken by the SCHR Certification Review, to which many of you contributed.
