This crisis likely represents the most serious food insecurity situation in the world today, in terms of both scale and severity. Current humanitarian response is inadequate to meet emergency needs according to an inter-agency scenario building analysis at the end of May. Furthermore, FEWSNET with partners estimated that  2011 is the driest year or second direst year in the Eastern Horn of Africa  since 1950/51 in some areas and the food security situation for pastoralists and marginal agriculturalists  is not likely to improve until early 2012.

Dadaab Information Needs Assessment: Communication is AIDJacobo Quintanilla, Director of Humanitarian Media at Internews (www.internews.org), will brief on the findings of the joint humanitarian communication needs assessment conducted in Dadaab in August 2011 to understand the informationneeds of refugees and explore ways to improve the flow of communication between refugees, aid agencies, and host communities. Internews and the BBC World Service Trust are partners in the infoasaid (http://infoasaid.org/) DfID funded consortium focusing on improving how aid agencies communicate with disaster-affected communities. The emphasis is on the need to deliver information, as aid itself, through the most appropriate channels. Anita Shah, Head of Infoasaid, will introduce the project. Background: Serious communication gaps between the humanitarian sector and refugees in Dadaab, Kenya, are increasing refugee suffering and putting lives at risk, according to this new joint assessmentreport. Radio is by far the most popular source of general information for both new arrivals and long-term refugees, yet there is no specific regular broadcast for or about Dadaab. Critically, humanitarian workers, government officials, along with army andpolice, rank the lowest as sources of information for refugees, both for new arrivals and long-term residents, according to the report. The assessment team trained a group of local volunteers from the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) on usingsmart phones with data collection software designed by Episurveyor to conduct over 640 interviews for the survey. See video.The assessment was led byInternews and conducted with Radio Ergo/International Media Support (IMS) and Star FM of Kenya with support from NRC.

Land is needed for emergency shelter or camps, for livelihoods and food security, for temporary roads and other critical infrastructure.  Land mines and unexploded ordnances (UXOs) limit available land for any use. Lack of clarity regarding land rights can delay humanitarian response, can undermine the effectiveness of assistance, can contribute to or exacerbate conflicts and can even place humanitarian staff at risk.Humanitarians are increasingly aware of the need to understand how land issues will affect their interventions and the affect of their interventions on land issues.

3084,0,1,Agenda,NULL,"Background of the report ""East Jerusalem; Key Humanitarian Concerns"". This report forms part of a series by OCHA which examines the humanitarian impact of Israeli measures such as the Barrier, settlements planning, and zoning restrictions, on Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt). The report focuses on East Jerusalem, on the area unilaterally annexed to Israel following the 1967 war.                 Since 1967, Israel has undertaken measures to alter the status of East Jerusalem, contrary to international law. These measures affect the residency status of East Jerusalem Palestinians, their access to education and health services, and their ability to plan and develop their communities. Combined, they significantly increase the humanitarian vulnerability of the Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem. East Jerusalem has also traditionally served as a focus for specialized medical care, university education, work, social & family relationships and for worship at the Muslim and Christian holy sites, for the entire Palestinian population of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israeli measures have increasingly cut off East Jerusalem from the remainder of the occupied Palestinian territory and construction of the Barrier is compounding the physical separation of the city from the rest of the West Bank. Therefore, while primarily focusing on the issues facing the Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem, this report will also emphasize the continuing importance of the city as a centre of life for Palestinians throughout the oPt.                The report was published recently and can be retrieved through:        http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_jerusalem_report_2011_03_23_web_english.pdf                        2. Children and Armed Conflict in the Central African Republic (16h45-17h00)                Ms. Eva Smets, Director, Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict, will introduce the report ""An uncertain future: Children in Armed Conflict in the Central African Republic."" Printed copies of the report will be available at the meeting.        The reports findings include the following:                 Of the six grave violations enumerated by the Security Council in its groundbreaking resolution 1612 (2005) and covered by the UN-led Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism (MRM), at least four violations are currently being committed against children in CAR: Abduction of children; Recruitment and use of child soldiers; Denial of humanitarian access to children; and Attacks against schools or hospitals.        The LRA is present and active in CAR, despite efforts to drive it from the region. The LRA is abducting children in the southeast of CAR. Abducted children are raped, used as sex slaves and forced to attack villages and kill others, including other children.         The children who manage to escape the LRA experience great difficulties returning to their families. They rarely receive much-needed assistance, such as psychosocial care, to heal from these traumatic events. These children also suffer an arduous journey home that often takes them as long as the time they actually spent in captivity.         Other findings highlight the recruitment and use of children by self-defense militias and the CPJP, as well as the need for long-term reintegration programs for children released by the APRD. ",0,0

3088,2069,2,Background,NULL,"Gender-based violence (GBV) encompasses a wide range of human rights violations and can be directed at women, men, girls and boys. GBV takes the form of rape, domestic violence, sexual assault and harassment, trafficking of women, girls and boys and several harmful traditional practices including female genital mutilation/cutting, child marriage, bride inheritance and many others. It is pervasive in times of peace. In times of crisis, GBV may become more extreme. In armed conflict, one form of GBV, sexual violence, can become so widespread and systematic that it is considered a weapon in conflict and can escalate into crimes against humanity, war crimes or be part of the crime of genocide.

The Haiti IA RTE included a first phase on the initial response, completed in May 2010. This second phase has sought to:Analyse and provide lessons for the ongoing response, with a particular focus on coordination between different actors involved;Examine options for linking humanitarian response structures with longer-term and/or government-established mechanisms; andReview the extent to which the findings and recommendations from the first phase of the Inter-Agency Real-Time Evaluation have informed the evolving humanitarian response in Haiti.The humanitarian response to the initial catastrophe has developed in context of multiple crises, including the cholera epidemic, hurricanes, and political and security challenges. Transition to recovery has been strong on the agenda as a result of growing desire to move away from humanitarian response and relief and offer durable solutions to existing needs amidst increasing funding constraints.

Financing Preparedness - Findings of a Study (1st Phase) and What to Do About Them,NULL,"In the context of rising demands placed on the humanitarian system and constrained donor finances, and considering a seeming inability to have all in place that we need for crises that we know very well will occur, preparedness is being discussed and developed at many levels and many stakeholders. In early 2011 the IASC tasked FAO as Task Team lead for Preparedness Financing to examine in detail the financing architecture. Development Initiatives was asked to examine this issue in detail. Questions were asked of not just financing and financing models themselves but also of definitions, institutions, donors, aid structures and actors of all kinds. The result of this work was a report launched by FAO and the IASC in December 2011. Part of this work was also an initiative to track funding for emergency preparedness over a longer period of time, through to the middle of 2012. A final piece of work has now been undertaken to place the results of that tracking exercise in context of the developments in policy and practice. ",0,0
3281,2153,2,Background,NULL,"The results of this work are mixed. Although much of the humanitarian system is discussing preparedness and policy is being developed, there has been no increase in actual funding over the tracking period. Humanitarian financing mechanisms and the CAP have not changed significantly to provide more opportunities for preparedness financing. Donors are debating what to do with preparedness and are looking for options for financing but there has been little movement to date.

Lessons learnt are emerging and expectations becoming harmonised. NGO co-facilitation, however, remains largely undocumentented territory, whilst the experience varies widely. Oxfam (since July 2010) and Save the Children (since December 2011), with ECHO funding, have placed full time co-facilitators in the DRC protection cluster. A recent evaluation looks at the lessons learnt from this, and compares the experience with other clusters in DRC and the protection cluster in other countries. It asks when cofacilitators can bring a value added to the functioning of a cluster, and what the NGO value added should be, including in countries with an integrated mission; what the engagement of the lead agency and cofacilitating organisation needs to be, what preconditions need to be in place, and under what circumstances cofacilitation can be successful.

He will discuss, why this tool is a key for disaster managers worldwide and how it can be used effectively. Thomas Peter will also present new initiatives to improve the GDACS services, how they link to other coordination mechanisms and their opportunity to support cluster coordination.During the first days after major sudden-onset disasters, the affected country and a vast number of international actors collect and analyse information in order to plan their response. This activity is typically carried out simultaneously with varying speed, relevance and accuracy, using multiple information channels and applying different procedures.During the initial planning phase, there is usually little or no information exchange between international responders. Decisions are often based on patchy information, inaccurate sources or assumptions. The planned or mobilised assistance of other organisations is rarely drawn into consideration. This often results in duplication, gaps, overlap or even inappropriate response, occasionally associated with high costs. GDACS services aim at facilitating information exchange among all actors in support of decision-making and coordination. GDACS services build on the collective knowledge of disaster managers worldwide and the joint capacity of all relevant disaster information systems.",0,0

3429,2306,3,Background,NULL,"Linking climate change or global warming to current events has long been considered unconventional. But new heat records are now broken almost every year and other abnormalities are fast accumulating: last Octobers Hurricane Sandy for instance was the largest storm ever recorded in the Atlantic. These inconsistencies are making it easier for scientists to pin effects happening now on climate change. Few groups however have studied the full implications of an already changed climate in humanitarian and development terms. The Climate Vulnerability Monitor teases these implications out of leading research with startling conclusions, such as attributing 20% of the damage caused by todays flood emergencies to climate change. Its analysis of 24 sectors of impact and findings from field research in Africa and Asia help to explain how the shift to inhospitable climate conditions could already be a critical factor driving the erosion of rural livelihoods and fueling migration, risk and food emergencies in regions like the Sahel. Just as this research explores unchartered territories, what it means for the humanitarian community is only beginning to become clear. Independent even of the causes of climate change, the bottom line of much of todays climate science is serious growing shockwaves for the humanitarian space. ",0,0

The purpose of the Conference was to begin a facts-based discussion of the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons detonation with key stakeholders. It was attended by 127 States, representatives of the UN (FAO, IAEA, OCHA, ODA, UNEP, UNHCR, UNICEF, WFP, WHO), ICRC and IFRC, independent experts and more than 150 civil society representatives under the umbrella of the International Coalition for the Abolition of Nuclear Weapons (ICAN). The Conference was framed around three themes: the immediate humanitarian impact of a nuclear detonation; the wider impact and longer-term consequences; and humanitarian preparedness and response. The discussions revealed a consensus among the majority of States that the detonation of one or more nuclear weapons, be it deliberate or accidental, would have a devastating and catastrophic humanitarian impact both in the short and long term. Its effects would not be limited in time or space and it would have major social, economic and, potentially, environmental consequences. Given the inability of national and international actors to respond in any meaningful way, the majority of States expressed the view that there was a need for an international, legally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons.

The growing momentum around the concept of resilience offers considerable potential to achieve this, but only if all actors work together to turn rhetoric into action that brings lasting improvements for the poorest communities across the Sahel.

A part of these abuses though by no means all are committed by ANSAs. However, the nature of international law makes it difficult to address the behaviour of these groups. Existing International Humanitarian Law treaties are predominantly focused on states, and, while they have obligations under IHL, ANSAs cannot become parties to relevant international treaties. Thus, ANSAs may not feel bound to respect rules that they have neither contributed to creating nor formally declared their willingness to adhere to. Geneva Call aims to promote and enhance ANSA compliance with international humanitarian norms.While initially focusing on land mines, Geneva Call has expanded its work on international norms pertaining to the protection of children notably the recruitment and use of children in hostilities  and to the prohibition on sexual violence in armed conflict.In its efforts to promote ownership of international standards, Geneva Call has adopted an inclusive approach, whereby ANSAs have the opportunity  through signing a formal instrument called aDeed of Commitment to express their adherence to specific humanitarian norms and to be held accountable for their pledge.In recent years, Geneva Call has also increasingly provided ANSAs with customised training on broad International Humanitarian Law rules, as well as advice on how to incorporate these rules into their codes of conduct and other internal regulations.",0,0

Risk Reduction Index in West Africa,NULL,"DARA will present the second report of the Risk Reduction Index (RRI), carried out in West Africa (Cape Verde, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Niger and Senegal). In West Africa, underlying risk drivers continue to increase communities vulnerability to natural hazards, decrease their resilience overall, and potentially diminish important development gains that have been made. As in the first phase of the RRI carried out in 2009-2010 in Central America the 2013 RRI West Africa measured local perceptions of risks and has identified links between underlying risk factors and increased vulnerability, raising awareness around the need for greater risk management initiatives. The goal of the RRI is to generate knowledge in the region that will help civil society, local administrations, national governments, and ECOWAS address underlying factors of risk from a more integrated perspective. The RRI also aims to promote better integration of DRR into development, poverty reduction and humanitarian strategies and policies of all stakeholders, including operational agencies. A main output of the second phase is the RRI publication containing the main findings of the field research carried out in 16 communities across 6 countries in West Africa, as well as a Regional Risk Mapping. The launch of the RRI publication will serve as an opportunity for DARA to share its findings from our research in West Africa and our community-based methodological approach with the development and humanitarian community.

Predicting the Unpredictable - A proposal for reducing supply chain waste in international humanitarian response,NULL,"Few people involved in humanitarian response would argue that current donor funding patterns,  agency logistics, preparedness and response activities could be better directed and create a greater positive impact if they were informed by accurate forecast information of what assistance will be required.  Also, not many people believe that accurate long term needs and assessment of requirements at the point of a disaster can be forecasted. Our research project, funded by the Norwegian Research Council, set out to prove that it is possible to generate this information and support the planning process, increasing predictability and so allowing donors and agencies to develop more efficient supply chains.  In a pilot project a needs forecast model called the Humanitarian Logistics Demand Forecast (HLDF) has been created by analysing more than 30,000 data inputs across 63 disasters that occurred during 2005-2010 to create needs characterisation models for a given disaster type in a given region. The HLDF produces information that can be used to guide donors or agencies with strategic planning, as well as providing the ability to predict the demand for a particular disaster of a known size in a given area. The tool is particularly useful to initiate a response whilst waiting for results from the needs assessments being carried out. IFRC used the tool as one of the components in developing their 5 year logistics strategy, defining product volumes and the required logistics capacity. The HLDF is the first of its kind on a global basis. Given their role as a coordination platform, we are keen to seek feedback from IASC on the usefulness of this approach in coordination activities, and the validity of further development and investment in such a tool. Also, Birgitte Stalder-Olsen will share IFRC's experience to use the HDLF for their logistics contingency planning for 2014/2015. ",0,0
