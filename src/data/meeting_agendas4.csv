The presentation will include how FAO focuses on recovery and rehabilitation to increase community resilience, and on how  FAO uses a sustainable livelihoods framework (SLF).  Ms. Nyberg  will also brief on the DRM-related projects such as:  hazard risk preparedness in agriculture and good practice in South and South East Asia; local emergency preparedness in Caribbean countries highly prone to hurricane related disasters; lessons learned from nutrition in emergencies; disaster risk reduction projects in Belize, China, Moldova, Nepal and Pakistan; cross-border collaboration to manage and reduce risk of transboundary animal and plant pests and diseases, including desert locusts; and emergency livestock and seed assessment guidelines.  The presentation will also address FAO's livelihood-based approach to climate change adaptation at grass roots level, including piloting of agricultural practices in Bangladesh and building capacity for rural populations to adapt to climate change.  FAO works closely with the UNFCCC to develop good practice examples of adaptation to climate change and climate variability.  ",,,0,0
2378,1641,2,UNDP's Briefing on the Global Risk Identification Programme (GRIP),,"Accurate data on hazards, vulnerabilities, risks, and past disaster losses provide the essential evidence base to design and implement policies and programmes that can effectively prevent or mitigate the impact of dangerous natural events. The Global Risk Identification Programme (GRIP) is the official platform for Risk Identification, one of the five priority areas of the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA). GRIPäó»s goal is to promote sustainable development by reducing the impact of natural hazards in high risk areas. To achieve this goal, GRIP has two specific objectives: to improve disaster risk information and to increase its use in decision-making processes.  GRIPäó»s actions to help countries reach the HFA goal are divided in the following three main activities: (a) developing capacity; (b) generating basic risk information and baselines, and (c) monitoring and reporting.  To support countries with their risk assessment needs, GRIP has developed a comprehensive risk assessment package with activities at national and local levels. The package includes the implementation of multi-hazard National Risk Assessments, the establishment of National Disaster Observatories and the preparation of the National Urban Risk Report. GRIP-supported activities are currently being implemented in about 30 countries worldwide. Dr. Carlos Villacis, UNDP's GRIP Coordinator, will introduce the Programme to the participants.",0,0
2379,1641,1,"I:ŒæŒæŒæ WMO's Briefing on Risk Identification and Assessments Dr. Maryam Golnaraghi, Chief of Disaster Risk Reduction Programme of WMO will brief on WMO's efforts in support of Risk identification and assessments to support risk reduction and risk transfer markets. WMO Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Programme's, a strategic plan has been developed to contribute more effectively to three components of disaster risk management including, (i) risk identification and assessment, (ii) risk reduction such as sectoral planning, early warning systems, and emergency preparedness programmes, and (iii) financial risk transfer mechanisms such as Catastrophe Insurance and Weather Risk Management markets. A fundamental requirement for effective DRR is the availability of historical and real-time systematic and consistent observations of hydro-meteorological parameters, complemented with other forecast products providing information on expected patterns of hazards from the next hour to longer time frames. This must be complemented with tools and methodologies for hazard analysis, mapping and probabilistic risk modelling.Œæ Dr. Golnaraghi will present on how WMO is working to support capacity development at the national level in this area.",,,0,0
