The Haiti IA RTE included a first phase on the initial response, completed in May 2010. This second phase has sought to: Analyse and provide lessons for the ongoing response, with a particular focus on coordination between different actors involved; Examine options for linking humanitarian response structures with longer-term and/or government-established mechanisms; and Review the extent to which the findings and recommendations from the first phase of the Inter-Agency Real-Time Evaluation have informed the evolving humanitarian response in Haiti. The humanitarian response to the initial catastrophe has developed in context of multiple crises, including the cholera epidemic, hurricanes, and political and security challenges. Transition to recovery has been strong on the agenda as a result of growing desire to move away from humanitarian response and relief and offer durable solutions to existing needs amidst increasing funding constraints.

The decline of old media and the rise of social networks, mobile phones and easy-to-use online mapping is revolutionising how news and information is gathered and disseminated. How is this playing out in the humanitarian sector, and what trends are shaping coverage of crises and the practice of humanitarian information and communications?",0,0
3103,2074,2,Background,,"Ben Parker is a specialist in humanitarian affairs and media. Since 1989 he has worked mainly for UN agencies in Africa, but also as a freelance writer and technology consultant.

He set up the initial editorial and online systems for IRIN, and later moved into web publishing in the private sector with Africa Online. As a UN communications officer in Sudan from 2003-2006, he was closely involved in raising the alarm about Darfur internationally.

3088,2069,2,Background,,"Gender-based violence (GBV) encompasses a wide range of human rights violations and can be directed at women, men, girls and boys. GBV takes the form of rape, domestic violence, sexual assault and harassment, trafficking of women, girls and boys and several harmful traditional practices including female genital mutilation/cutting, child marriage, bride inheritance and many others. It is pervasive in times of peace. In times of crisis, GBV may become more extreme. In armed conflict, one form of GBV, sexual violence, can become so widespread and systematic that it is considered a weapon in conflict and can escalate into crimes against humanity, war crimes or be part of the crime of genocide.

3057,2023,2,Background:,,"Humanitarian concern for Syria continues as the civil unrest enters its eighth month. According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, security forces have killed more than 2,900 people. Thousands of others have been injured, displaced or detained since mid-March. A UN humanitarian mission, which was led by OCHA and took place in late August, concluded that the humanitarian situation in Syria could be characterised as having pockets of humanitarian needs, but that they together could not be described as a country-wide humanitarian crisis urgently requiring international assistance. However, the humanitarian situation may further deteriorate. Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed has served as Resident Coordinator in Syria since May 2008 and was designated Humanitarian Coordinator in August this year.

He will provided examples from recent crises to illustrate both the challenges as well as some lessons learned. UN-HABITAT chairs the Housing, Land and Property Area of Responsibility within the Protection Cluster.",0,0
3054,2022,2,Background,,"Unaddressed land issues contribute to the increased negative impact of both natural disasters and violent conflict. Poor land-use increases vulnerability to natural disasters, as demonstrated in New Orleans, Port-au-Prince and the Horn of Africa.  Landäó»s critical importance to livelihoods, investment, group identity and the distribution of power make it a potent factor in the outbreak or continuation of conflict and to the success or failure of post-conflict peace-building. Land issues directly affect many aspects of humanitarian action. Land is needed for emergency shelter or camps, for livelihoods and food security, for temporary roads and other critical infrastructure.  Land mines and unexploded ordnances (UXOs) limit available land for any use. Lack of clarity regarding land rights can delay humanitarian response, can undermine the effectiveness of assistance, can contribute to or exacerbate conflicts and can even place humanitarian staff at risk. Humanitarians are increasingly aware of the need to understand how land issues will affect their interventions and the affect of their interventions on land issues.  The challenge is to ensure that humanitarian action contributes to long-term solutions that address core vulnerabilities and root causes of crises. Early engagement of national and international land expertise is a critical input to humanitarian action.",0,0

Internews and the BBC World Service Trust are partners in the infoasaid (http://infoasaid.org/) DfID funded consortium focusing on improving how aid agencies communicate with disaster-affected communities. The emphasis is on the need to deliver information, as aid itself, through the most appropriate channels. Anita Shah, Head of Infoasaid, will introduce the project.  Background: Serious communication gaps between the humanitarian sector and refugees in Dadaab, Kenya, are increasing refugee suffering and putting lives at risk, according to this new joint assessmentreport.  Radio is by far the most popular source of general information for both new arrivals and long-term refugees, yet there is no specific regular broadcast for or about Dadaab. Critically, humanitarian workers, government officials, along with army andpolice, rank the lowest as sources of information for refugees, both for new arrivals and long-term residents, according to the report. The assessment team trained a group of local volunteers from the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) on usingsmart phones with data collection software designed by Episurveyor to conduct over 640 interviews for the survey. See video.The assessment was led byInternews and conducted with Radio Ergo/International Media Support (IMS) and Star FM of Kenya with support from NRC.

2995,1994,2,Background,,"The eastern Horn of Africa has now experienced two consecutive season of significantly below-average rainfall. This has resulted in failed crop production, substantial livestock mortality, and has driven food prices to record levels. Millions of people in the region cannot meet basic survival needs and emergency levels of acute malnutrition are wide-spread. This crisis likely represents the most serious food insecurity situation in the world today, in terms of both scale and severity. Current humanitarian response is inadequate to meet emergency needs according to an inter-agency scenario building analysis at the end of May. Furthermore, FEWSNET with partners estimated that  2011 is the driest year or second direst year in the Eastern Horn of Africa  since 1950/51 in some areas and the food security situation for pastoralists and marginal agriculturalists  is not likely to improve until early 2012.  A food security emergency will persist over the coming months in the eastern Horn given the expectation of late and below average summer harvests, early depletion of pasture and water, and continued high prices for food, water, and fuel .'

Their numbers and impact have been increasing with patterns of hydro-meteorological events in particular shifting dramatically.Œæ Legal frameworks are an important tool to meet these challenges in respect to both risk reduction and response. When well-crafted, laws can focus and strengthen governmental efforts to prevent and respond to disasters, and they can empower communities and civil society organizations to contribute effectively to these aims.

To date 162,000 refugees from this group of some 220,000 Burundian refugees have been legally naturalized Tanzanian.

However, in the absence of significant structural changes to the environment, and first and foremost, a just and lasting peace, entrenched vulnerability remains a reality throughout the oPt. Indeed, the situation by the end of 2010 is characterized by on-going political stalemate, regular exposure to violence, continuing restrictions on access and movement, and persistent human rights violations äóñ all factors leading to a protracted humanitarian situation.
