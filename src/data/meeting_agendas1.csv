3607,2425,1,Description of Event,,"IASC Event: Data and Evidence about Conflict Affected People: Can we do Better? Is the data we get from crises settings good enough or can we do better? Or is it too much? These are the questions that will be the focus of this session. According to the People in Crises (PAC) Report, there has been a steady improvement in the quality of evidence produced by humanitarian actors. This is good news. It indicates that there is increased investment in this area by donors that allow the field agencies to collect data. On the other hand, is this data well used or used at all?  The discussion will briefly present the PAC Report, but mainly debate key issues for the future. These include: How to get the best out of available data: is it too little data or a lack of innovative techniques for analysis? Increasing the burden of data collection on operational staff: allocation of time and effort in the field in crisis settings. How can we increase the shelf life of data? Time gap between data collection and decision making. Join us for a discussion with Debarati Guha-Sapir from the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED), established at the University of Louvain, School of Medicine äóñ Institute of Health and Society, Brussels.

While the emergency response was by and large successful, more than four months since the storm hit, significant challenges to recovery remain. The typhoon also marked the first declaration of a Level 3 emergency by the IASC in the context of a large scale, sudden-onset disaster and offers important lessons on how to improve the implementation of the humanitarian program cycle under the Transformative Agenda. Refugees International (RI), an independent advocacy organization that advocates on behalf of people displaced by conflict and natural disasters, conducted a mission to the Philippines in February 2014 to assess the response to Typhoon Haiyan and the protection needs of those still displaced by the disaster (see links to the reports below).

Risk Reduction Index in West Africa,,"DARA will present the second report of the Risk Reduction Index (RRI), carried out in West Africa (Cape Verde, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Niger and Senegal). In West Africa, underlying risk drivers continue to increase communitiesäó» vulnerability to natural hazards, decrease their resilience overall, and potentially diminish important development gains that have been made. As in the first phase of the RRI carried out in 2009-2010 in Central America the 2013 RRI West Africa measured local perceptions of risks and has identified links between underlying risk factors and increased vulnerability, raising awareness around the need for greater risk management initiatives. The goal of the RRI is to generate knowledge in the region that will help civil society, local administrations, national governments, and ECOWAS address underlying factors of risk from a more integrated perspective. The RRI also aims to promote better integration of DRR into development, poverty reduction and humanitarian strategies and policies of all stakeholders, including operational agencies.  A main output of the second phase is the RRI publication containing the main findings of the field research carried out in 16 communities across 6 countries in West Africa, as well as a Regional Risk Mapping. The launch of the RRI publication will serve as an opportunity for DARA to share its findings from our research in West Africa and our community-based methodological approach with the development and humanitarian community.

3552,2360,1,1. Predicting the Unpredictable - A proposal for reducing supply chain waste in international humanitarian response,,"Few people involved in humanitarian response would argue that current donor funding patterns,  agency logistics, preparedness and response activities could be better directed and create a greater positive impact if they were informed by accurate forecast information of what assistance will be required.  Also, not many people believe that accurate long term needs and assessment of requirements at the point of a disaster can be forecasted. Our research project, funded by the Norwegian Research Council, set out to prove that it is possible to generate this information and support the planning process, increasing predictability and so allowing donors and agencies to develop more efficient supply chains.  In a pilot project a needs forecast model called the Humanitarian Logistics Demand Forecast (HLDF) has been created by analysing more than 30,000 data inputs across 63 disasters that occurred during 2005-2010 to create needs characterisation models for a given disaster type in a given region. The HLDF produces information that can be used to guide donors or agencies with strategic planning, as well as providing the ability to predict the demand for a particular disaster of a known size in a given area. The tool is particularly useful to initiate a response whilst waiting for results from the needs assessments being carried out. IFRC used the tool as one of the components in developing their 5 year logistics strategy, defining product volumes and the required logistics capacity. The HLDF is the first of its kind on a global basis. Given their role as a coordination platform, we are keen to seek feedback from IASC on the usefulness of this approach in coordination activities, and the validity of further development and investment in such a tool. Also, Birgitte Stalder-Olsen will share IFRC's experience to use the HDLF for their logistics contingency planning for 2014/2015. ",0,0

3544,2359,1,Geneva Call and the protection of civilians: is engagement of armed non-State actors (ANSAs) an option ?,,"Most of current armed conflict around the world involve one or several armed non-State actors.ŒæCivilians are the primary victims of these conflicts, and are exposed to all kinds of abuses. A part of these abusesŒæäóñ Œæthough by no means all äóñŒæare committed by ANSAs. However, the nature of international law makes it difficult to address the behaviour of these groups. Existing International Humanitarian Law treaties are predominantly focused on states, and, while they have obligations under IHL, ANSAs cannot become parties to relevant international treaties. Thus, ANSAs may not feel bound to respect rules that they have neither contributed to creating nor formally declared their willingness to adhere to. Geneva Call aims to promote and enhance ANSA compliance with international humanitarian norms.ŒæWhile initially focusing on land mines, Geneva Call has expanded its work on international norms pertaining to the protection of children notably the recruitment and use of children in hostilities äóñ and to the prohibition on sexual violence in armed conflict.ŒæIn its efforts to promote ownership of international standards, Geneva Call has adopted an inclusive approach, whereby ANSAs have the opportunity äóñ through signing a formal instrument called aŒæDeed of CommitmentŒæäóñ to express their adherence to specific humanitarian norms and to be held accountable for their pledge.ŒæIn recent years, Geneva Call has also increasingly provided ANSAs with customised training on broad International Humanitarian Law rules, as well as advice on how to incorporate these rules into their codes of conduct and other internal regulations.",0,0

The model was intended to stimulate discussion and generate feedback from all interested key stakeholders on what a successful, sustainable model might look like and how to achieve it. The project team received feedback from across the sector, with some 60 organizations submitting written feedback.

UNICEF's Cluster Lead Agency (CLA) Role:  How Well Has it Done and What Next?,,"The Cluster approach was introduced in 2005 and it was intended to improve emergency response through greater predictability and accountability, as well as stronger partnership between and among humanitarian actors. UNICEF serves as Global CLA for three Clusters: Nutrition, WASH and, as co-CLA with Save the Children, Education. In addition, within the Global Protection Cluster led by UNHCR, UNICEF is Focal Point Agency for the Child Protection AOR and co-Focal Point Agency with UNFPA for Gender-Based Violence (GBV) AOR. Together, these responsibilities render UNICEF the agency with the most Clusters and AORs under its remit. Evaluations, reviews and other exercises assessing UNICEFäó»s response to recent emergencies have pointed out that while the Organisation appears to be taking its CLA roles and responsibilities seriously, challenges still remain. An evaluation of UNICEFäó»s Cluster Lead Agency Role (CLARE) in Humanitarian Action was recently finalised. The evaluation was designed to undertake a systematic, in-depth and independent assessment of UNICEFäó»s performance in managing its CLA (and co-CLA) role on the Clusters under its remit. It includes information and data collected at the global level as well as eight country case studies.

However, Sri Lanka continues to be affected by small and medium scale natural disasters. These have also impacted returning IDPs and the scope of OCHAäó»s operations.  The Sri Lanka HCT and the Government of Sri Lanka are currently undertaking the first phases of a Joint Needs Assessment  (JNA) to create a baseline to target assistance from Government and ongoing relief and development activities. This will create a baseline for Government and development actors to continue in the recovery phase. In 2014, the OCHA Sri Lanka country office will downsize to a smaller Humanitarian Advisory Team (HAT) as the focus of preparedness for response will shift to the national level, with additional backstopping from the OCHA Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific, based in Bangkok. Central to OCHAäó»s work stream on preparedness for response will be to ensure that key elements of the the Minimum Preparedness Package (MPP) is in place as part of the UNDAF Pillar IV planning for Sri Lanka.",0,0

3488,2334,1,1. 'Unarmed Civilian Peacekeeping' - what's next?,,"How can civilians in situations of violent conflict, such as in South Sudan, Philippines or Myanmar, be protected? How can 'unarmed civilian peacekeeping' contribute to increased protection? The organisation 'Nonviolent Peaceforce' (NP) promotes, develops and implements 'unarmed civilian peacekeeping' (UCP) to protect civilians in these situations. NP envisions that this method ""using proven nonviolent strategies, is recognised as a viable alternative in preventing, addressing, and mitigating violent conflicts worldwide."" (NP website)The UN Secretary General's Report on the Protection of Civilians (S/2012/376) states that non-governmental organisations also play a long-established and key role in the protection of civilians. But what is UCP, how does it work in practice and how effective is it? How does it link to other notions of 'peacekeeping' and 'protection'? And what are some next steps? The IASC Secretariat is pleased to host this event, providing a space to discuss and better understand this concept from those who have applied it in situations like South Sudan, Mindanao and Myanmar. We are pleased to welcome the following panellists from Nonviolent Peaceforce.",0,0

3475,2326,1,1. Setting up Civil-Military Coordination Mechanisms in Complex Emergencies: Case Study Mali,,"Following the advance of several government opposition groups in northern Mali, an international military intervention took place to support the Malian military in order to regain control of that territory. In early January 2013, with the advance of the opposition groups towards the South of Mali, several nations, including France, started providing military assistance to the Malian Government. The conflict led to wide-spread displacement in 2012. As of June 2013, according to a report released by the Population Movement Commission, internally displaced persons were still estimated at 353,455 and 174,129 Malian refugees are still in neighbouring countries (UNHCR). Please find the latest Sitrep attached. Humanitarian activities were taking place, albeit with access constraints and amidst an environment of fragile humanitarian space. How does coordination in such a complex environment function? OCHA deployed as soon as January 2013 a UN-CMCoord officer to ensure the establishment and maintenance of essential liaison and coordination mechanisms between the Military and the Humanitarian Community.

3471,2325,1,1. The Internally Displaced - Identifying their Priority Needs,,"In the past few months, we discussed among others the impact of climate change, increased urbanisation and vulnerability, food security and resilience in the Sahel, the conflict in Syria, in  this IASC meeting fora. One of the common themes that has approached was that the impact of some of these trends and events led to increased internal displacement. For 2012, IDMC states that ""The total number of people internally displaced by armed conflict, generalised violence and human rights violations worldwide as of the end of 2012 was estimated to be 28.8 million. This represents an increase of 2.4 million on the previous year, and is the highest figure IDMC has ever recorded. Around 6.5 million people were newly displaced, almost twice as many as the 3.5 million during 2011.""At the same time, the priority needs of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) have not been discussed in this forum for some time. Therefore, we are particularly pleased that the following panellists will join us to discuss recent developments, themes and initiatives, and some of the priority needs and ongoing challenges for IDPs, at next weeks meeting.

Learning the Lessons? - Assessing the response to the 2012 Sahel food crisis,,"Ms Elise Ford, Oxfam Humanitarian Campaign Manager for West Africa and author of the Report ""Learning the Lessons? Assessing the response to the 2012 food crisis in the Sahel to build resilience for the future"" will discuss the major findings of the report. Oxfam, with contributions from Save the Children and ACF, has just published a paper on the Sahel food crisis. ŒæThe paper looks primarily at how the international community responded to the crisis and what can be done to build on the ""resilience"" momentum. ",0,0
3464,2321,2,Background,,"In 2012, the Sahel region of West and Central Africa was once again hit by a severe food crisis, affecting over 18 million people at its peak. At the start of 2012, when the crisis began to unfold, many governments, donors and aid agencies were determined not to make the same mistakes again. This report considers how well they collectively performed, and the lessons that must be learned to improve future responses. It is important for the humanitarian community that, while continuing to address the enormous humanitarian and recovery needs in the region, to learn lessons from the 2012 response and to develop a new model that will allow better prevention and management of future crises. The growing momentum around the concept of resilience offers considerable potential to achieve this, but only if all actors work together to turn rhetoric into action that brings lasting improvements for the poorest communities across the Sahel.

3453,2318,4,Background,,"In March 2013, Norway convened an International Conference on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons. The purpose of the Conference was to begin a facts-based discussion of the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons detonation with key stakeholders. It was attended by 127 States, representatives of the UN (FAO, IAEA, OCHA, ODA, UNEP, UNHCR, UNICEF, WFP, WHO), ICRC and IFRC, independent experts and more than 150 civil society representatives under the umbrella of the International Coalition for the Abolition of Nuclear Weapons (ICAN). The Conference was framed around three themes: the immediate humanitarian impact of a nuclear detonation; the wider impact and longer-term consequences; and humanitarian preparedness and response. The discussions revealed a consensus among the majority of States that the detonation of one or more nuclear weapons, be it deliberate or accidental, would have a devastating and catastrophic humanitarian impact both in the short and long term. Its effects would not be limited in time or space and it would have major social, economic and, potentially, environmental consequences. Given the inability of national and international actors to respond in any meaningful way, the majority of States expressed the view that there was a need for an international, legally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons.

3429,2306,3,Background,,"Linking climate change or global warming to current events has long been considered unconventional. But new heat records are now broken almost every year and other abnormalities are fast accumulating: last Octoberäó»s Hurricane Sandy for instance was the largest storm ever recorded in the Atlantic. These inconsistencies are making it easier for scientists to pin effects happening now on climate change. Few groups however have studied the full implications of an already changed climate in humanitarian and development terms. The äóìClimate Vulnerability Monitoräó teases these implications out of leading research with startling conclusions, such as attributing 20% of the damage caused by todayäó»s flood emergencies to climate change. Its analysis of 24 sectors of impact and findings from field research in Africa and Asia help to explain how the shift to inhospitable climate conditions could already be a critical factor driving the erosion of rural livelihoods and fueling migration, risk and food emergencies in regions like the Sahel. Just as this research explores unchartered territories, what it means for the humanitarian community is only beginning to become clear. Independent even of the causes of climate change, the bottom line of much of todayäó»s climate science is serious growing shockwaves for the humanitarian space. ",0,0
