3404,2229,2,Background,,"IHP was created in 1995 as an informal cooperation network to provide operational and logistical support to UN and other humanitarian agencies, primarily in sudden onset disasters. Over nearly 20 years of operations, IHP has become an indispensable tool for humanitarian coordination and response. It has been active in nearly every major disaster of that period, including the Indian Ocean tsunami, the Haiti earthquake and Pakistan floods. Today IHP support modules include the provision of staff and equipment to establish On-Site Operations Coordination Centres (OSOCCs) and base camps with accommodation and facilities for humanitarian staff, as well as support for ICT, information management, security system compliance and vehicle support, but the network is also open for requests outside of the predefined services.",0,0

3402,2228,0,Background,,Resilience' is the new buzz word - but what does it actually mean and how can it be conceptualised? This IASC special event is an opportunity to gain a better understanding of how resilience can support affected people and what the role of humanitarians could be. The panellists will present different perspectives on resilience and what it could mean in practice. The discussion will focus on how resilience relates to different approaches such as Preparedness and Disaster Risk Reduction and which role humanitarian organisations can play. The presentations and discussions will illustrate how a resilience approach could look like and what the different organisational and individual responsibilities in this approach would be.,0,0

The effective us of the global disaster alert and coordination system,,"Mr. Thomas Peter, Manager Emergency centre Relief Coordination Centre and GDACS Secretariat, OCHA, will discuss the effective use of the GDACS system, with special focus on the virtual on-site operations coordination centre (OSOCC). He will discuss, why this tool is a key for disaster managers worldwide and how it can be used effectively. Thomas Peter will also present new initiatives to improve the GDACS services, how they link to other coordination mechanisms and their opportunity to support cluster coordination. During the first days after major sudden-onset disasters, the affected country and a vast number of international actors collect and analyse information in order to plan their response. This activity is typically carried out simultaneously with varying speed, relevance and accuracy, using multiple information channels and applying different procedures. During the initial planning phase, there is usually little or no information exchange between international responders. Decisions are often based on patchy information, inaccurate sources or assumptions. The planned or mobilised assistance of other organisations is rarely drawn into consideration. This often results in duplication, gaps, overlap or even inappropriate response, occasionally associated with high costs. GDACS services aim at facilitating information exchange among all actors in support of decision-making and coordination. GDACS services build on the collective knowledge of disaster managers worldwide and the joint capacity of all relevant disaster information systems.",0,0

Lessons learnt are emerging and expectations becoming harmonised. NGO co-facilitation, however, remains largely undocumentented territory, whilst the experience varies widely. Oxfam (since July 2010) and Save the Children (since December 2011), with ECHO funding, have placed full time co-facilitators in the DRC protection cluster. A recent evaluation looks at the lessons learnt from this, and compares the experience with other clusters in DRC and the protection cluster in other countries. It asks when cofacilitators can bring a value added to the functioning of a cluster, and what the NGO value added should be, including in countries with an integrated mission; what the engagement of the lead agency and cofacilitating organisation needs to be, what preconditions need to be in place, and under what circumstances cofacilitation can be successful.

Instead, the humanitarian crisis affects all parts of the population in all areas of the country.The humanitarian response has been significantly expanded in 2012 to address the growing humanitarian needs in Yemen.

3280,2153,1,1. Financing Preparedness - Findings of a Study (1st Phase) and What to Do About Them,,"In the context of rising demands placed on the humanitarian system and constrained donor finances, and considering a seeming inability to have all in place that we need for crises that we know very well will occur, preparedness is being discussed and developed at many levels and many stakeholders. In early 2011 the IASC tasked FAO as Task Team lead for Preparedness Financing to examine in detail the financing architecture. Development Initiatives was asked to examine this issue in detail. Questions were asked of not just financing and financing models themselves but also of definitions, institutions, donors, aid structures and actors of all kinds. The result of this work was a report launched by FAO and the IASC in December 2011. Part of this work was also an initiative to track funding for emergency preparedness over a longer period of time, through to the middle of 2012. A final piece of work has now been undertaken to place the results of that tracking exercise in context of the developments in policy and practice. ",0,0
3281,2153,2,Background,,"The results of this work are mixed. Although much of the humanitarian system is discussing preparedness and policy is being developed, there has been no increase in actual funding over the tracking period. Humanitarian financing mechanisms and the CAP have not changed significantly to provide more opportunities for preparedness financing. Donors are debating what to do with preparedness and are looking for options for financing but there has been little movement to date. Resilience is taking more and more of the focus which could impact both positively and negatively on financing for preparedness. Under the umbrella of resilience, there are new opportunities and challenges.",0,0

3248,2145,2,Background,,"Whilst the importance of local capacity for disaster prevention and response is consistently recognised in emergency response evaluations, local and national humanitarian actors continue to be side-lined and partnership approaches devalued as inherently risky within the sector.  The role of local and national civil society was a central debate at the ICVA assembly in March 2012 and its importance is shaping thinking on resilience and disaster-proof development in debates on Rio+20 and post-2015. A significant step-change is needed in practice, mindset, funding and coordination structures if the humanitarian capacity is to be built and empowered to deal with the changing nature of disaster risks and response management.",0,0

Operational since 1995, the FT is currently composed by 22 UN departments, agencies, funds and programmes that work together to support the development of interagency conflict prevention initiatives. The FT facilitates the UN Conflict Prevention Community of Practice to support conflict transformation and peacebuilding practitioners within the UN and develops thematic knowledge products and guidance materials to enhance sustainable conflict transformation programmes around the world. Currently, the FT is leading two interagency initiatives to deepen understanding and practice on natural resources and conflict prevention and to catalyze system-wide strengthening of conflict-sensitive practice, programming and policy.",0,0
