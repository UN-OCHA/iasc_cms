IASC Theme

This theme extensively uses Bootstrap v3 for many of its styles and classes naming convention. Full documentation can be found at http://getbootstrap.com/ 

View the sass variables in assets/sass/global/_bootstrap-variables.scss and only create styles for when bootstrap doesn't offer the ones needed.
